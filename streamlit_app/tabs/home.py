                ### Context
                Blood is made up of 3 main cell types.  These cells are generally subjected to morphological analysis by blood 
                experts in order to detect possible blood diseases. This is a risky, time-consuming task if these practitioners 
                don't have the right tools.

                ### Aim
                The goal of this project is to to identify the different types of blood cells using computer vision algorithms. 
                The density and relative abundance of blood cells in the smear is crucial for the diagnosis of many pathologies, 
                such as leukemia, which relies on the ratio of lymphocytes. The identification of abnormal leukocytes in 
                pathologies such as leukemia could complete this first part. Developing a tool capable of analyzing cells from 
                blood smears could facilitate the diagnosis of certain pathologies, but could also be used for research purposes.
